**Remove All Ads from ChatGPT - 100% Free**

adblockerGPT is a free, lightweight Chrome extension that blocks advertisements and sponsored content on ChatGPT. Enjoy a clean, distraction-free AI experience without interruptions.

**Why adblockerGPT?**

ChatGPT now displays ads to free-tier users. These advertisements appear as product recommendation cards, sponsored suggestions, and promotional content that interrupt your workflow. adblockerGPT removes all of these instantly.

**Key Features:**

- Blocks all ChatGPT ad formats (product cards, banners, sponsored content)
- Ultra-lightweight (under 50KB) - no impact on browser performance
- Zero data collection - we never track, store, or transmit your data
- Works automatically - no configuration needed
- Updates regularly to catch new ad patterns
- Completely free - no premium tiers, no subscriptions

**Privacy First:**

Unlike other extensions, adblockerGPT collects absolutely no user data:
- No browsing history tracked
- No ChatGPT conversations stored
- No personal information collected

- All processing happens locally in your browser

**How It Works:**

1. Install the extension (one click)
2. Visit ChatGPT (chat.openai.com or chatgpt.com)
3. Enjoy ad-free conversations

The extension activates automatically when you visit ChatGPT. It uses advanced pattern detection to identify and remove advertisement elements before they're displayed.

We request only the minimum permissions necessary:
- activeTab: To detect when you're on ChatGPT
- storage: To save your preferences locally
- Host permissions: Only for chat.openai.com and chatgpt.com
