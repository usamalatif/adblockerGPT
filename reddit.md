Title: I made a free ad blocker specifically for ChatGPT

Post:

Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I've been using ChatGPT daily and noticed the sponsored content creeping in. It was getting annoying, so I built a simple browser extension to block it.

**What it does:**

- Removes sponsored messages and promotional banners from ChatGPT
- Shows a counter of blocked ads
- Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave
- Completely free (no premium, no catch)

**Privacy:** No data collection, no tracking. Everything runs locally in your browser.

It's called adblockerGPT - you can find it at adblockergpt.com

Would love to hear your feedback or feature requests!
